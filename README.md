The Firefighter Down: CPR Project
======
When the unthinkable happens, and a firefighter collapses on an emergency scene, we need to be prepared to provide the highest level of care possible. We know that good neurological outcomes can be had in out of hospital cardiac arrest provided high quality chest compressions are initiated early. Unfortunately, the resuscitation of a downed firefighter presents a special concern: they're in full turn out gear with an SCBA!

In essence we have an access issue. Before we can initiate chest compressions we must extricate the fallen firefighter from their gear. Undirected attempts at removal of turnout gear is time consuming and chaotic. Therefore, we have developed a simple technique to doff the gear from an unresponsive firefighter which requires minimal training and no additional equipment.
