# The science behind FD-CPR

Over half of all Line of Duty Deaths for firefighters in the US are attributable to heart attacks or strokes, 
not traumatic injury. Even among firefighters younger than 45 years old almost 15% of deaths were 
attributable to MI. Is it their job? Their lifestyle? Something else? 

The evidence suggests that there are complex processes that occurs in our bodies when we fight a 
fire. From the moment the alarm sounds, especially at night, our physiology changes. Research shows 
that noxious arousal causes T-wave changes, indicating [.............]. Then when we arrive at the fire, we 
perform strenuous work, in heavy and insulating PPE, under psychological and environmental extremes. 
This leads to significant cardiovascular and thermal strain, causing a concerning change, not only in 
myocardial function, but also in our blood chemistry and hematological measurements which persist for 
hours.

Are the alterations in myocardial functions placing us at a greater risk for sudden cardiac arrest? The 
evidence is inconclusive. We need to advocate for more research! However, studies due suggest that 
there is an increased risk of thrombosis due to a pro-coagulatory state from the hematological changes, 
which places us at an increased vulnerability to myocardial infarction after fighting fire. In summary, 
other research supports a 2007 study by Kales and coworkers who clearly demonstrated that the 
relative risk of suffering from a fatal cardiac event was 10â€“100 times greater following fire-suppression 
activities than during non-fire duties.

Our profession is called to protect the citizens in our community while helping those in need. We 
also need to start taking steps in protecting our selves through education, advocating, and planning. 
[....needs a filler, connection to the end ...] We need to understand the risk so we can mitigate a 
potential target. We need to be prepared to do our job, especially when the one that needs our help is 
one of our own.

What would you do if one of your own suffered a sudden cardiac arrest? What if they suffered that SCA 
while in full turnout gear with an SCBA? 

This lecture will give you new perspectives on the resuscitation of a downed firefighter.
