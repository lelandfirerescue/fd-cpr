# The story behind Firefighter Down: CPR

The **Firefighter Down: CPR project** is a true collaboration powered by social media and a drive by many 
individuals that are dedicated to enhance the resuscitation of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) victims. When 
we started to address the resuscitation of a firefighter that suffered SCA, it became very personal.

In 2010, Captain Tom Bouthillet from Hilton Head Island Fire Department posted a question on 
[ems12lead.com: How can we initiate high quality compressions in a firefighter donned in full PPE faster?](http://www.ems12lead.com/2010/01/06/cardiac-arrest-are-you-ready-to-save-one-of-our-own/)

In the subsequent week, Lt. Christopher Watford approached FF Michael Herbert at Leland Fire/Rescue 
and suggested using the SCBA as the default CPR board and to stabilize it with the legs of a firefighter. 

We gathered the on-duty crew and immediately tried different techniques. We found that the SCBA 
functioned as a good platform to initiate immediate compressions on a down firefighter. We practiced 
different techniques in removing the gear with the goal of not interrupting chest compressions.

The following 10-step technique became our FD-CPR approach; however, we found that many steps 
can be performed simultaneously, reducing the time to doff the firefighter to 30 seconds, all while 
maintaining high quality compressions.

The 10 step process is:

-	**Step 1**:
    - **Rescuer 1**: Drag the downed firefighter to a safe location to initiate care.
    - Rescuer 1 should drag the firefighter from behind, drop to the ground and
      position the SCBA bottle between Rescuer 1's legs. 
    - Rescuer 1's legs will serve to stabilize the SCBA so that it can be used as CPR platform.
-	**Step 2**:
    - **Rescuer 2**: Should pop open the chest clip of the SCBA if applicable and initiate
      high quality compressions thru the Turnout Gear Jacket. 
    - Rescuer 2 should be a firefighter a "fresh" firefighter, (i.e. the engineer or a member
      of RIT that has not yet performed strenuous firefighting activity). The quality of compressions
      are paramount, and under these circumstances, fatigue and a decline in compression quality will be rapid.
- **Step 3**:
    - **Rescuer 1**: If the SCBA mask is still in place, open the SCBA bypass valve. This step can also
      be performed by Rescuer 2 quickly. 
    - The purpose is two-fold: 
      - to allow for passive ventilation with compressions, and
      - allow for rescuers to identify an etiology of cardiac arrest. We can identify if the down
        firefighter ran out of air and address aggressive oxygenation. The SCBA air level gauges should
        be inspected following removal of the downed firefighter.

**Steps 4 â€“ 8** should be performed in a coordinated method but simultaneously to the best of the
ability of the rescuers. Do not interfere with compressions. Depending on the style of gear your
department carries, modifications may need to be made; however, we are firefighters and will get
the job done!

- **Step 4**:
    - **Rescuer 1**: Remove helmet, mask, and hood.
- **Step 5**:
    - **Rescuer 3**: Position yourself at the waist and start to unbuckle the turnout gear jacket from the bottom up.
- **Step 6**:
    - **Rescuer 1**: Loosen shoulder straps of the SCBA and position the arms of the down firefighter above his/her head.
- **Step 7**:
    - **Rescuer 1 and Rescuer 3**: Work the zipper (or buckles) of the turnout gear jacket open. Do not interfere with compressions.
- **Step 8**:
    - **Rescuer 1**: (This is a make or break step.) Rescuer 1 needs to grasp the turnout gear jacket
      and the SCBA shoulder straps of the down firefighter firmly.
    - **Prepare for the "pull down."** Rescuer 1, who is at the head of the down firefighter, will give
      the final command to perform the "pull down."
- **Step 9**:
    - **Rescuer 3 and Rescuer 4**: Each Rescuer needs to firmly grab one of the down firefighter legs
      and coordinate the "pull down" method with Rescuer 1 at the head. Rescuer 1 will give the
      command to perform "pull down."
    - **Rescuer 3 and Rescuer 4**: pull the down firefighter toward his/her feet and out of the
      turnout gear jacket and SCBA.
- **Step 10**:
    - **All rescuers**: Initiate a comprehensive resuscitation bundle! The first step is to continue
      high quality compressions with a "fresh" person.

We launched the FD-CPR.com website to share our idea after we received a large number of
requests by department in North Carolina to share our EM Today presentation. We hope that it will help.
